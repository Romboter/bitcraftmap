## Roadmap

0 rewrite code to have generic geoJson

1 Sort icons, make icon list and layer list for validation
0.1 0.2 : move coordinate finder + coordinate a mouse cursor + coordinate and biome finder
2 Work on user interface
3 make the higher resolution hexagon map with opencv and numpy

## Wild ideas board

- Pathfinder using terrain elevation data
- Coordinates to biome calculator
- Rewrite to Typescript
- Query the database instead of getting data from bitjita
- Calculate walkable zones (ie where cart can go because there is no water)
- Do a community map instead of a spoiler map at launch
- "count" each filter
- Save setting via cookie or local storage ?
- Have a lexicon with resources screenshots
- show list of opened job on the map
- show dropped item on the map (lol)
- Optional : slice the map in 9
- chunk coord ?
- freeze coordinates information when clicking a waypoint

- User Intercae
  - Turn on / Turn off all waypoint
  - New interface that follow bitcraft style
  - Options that allow you to draw on the map

- Players data
  - Show player waystone
  - Show player missing waystones
  - calculate 'closest known waystone' to a location
  - Calculate player heat density zones
  - Show players on the map dynamically
  - See people exploration level in real time
  - Crazy idea : live map of all players, and text bubble above them that show what they say (lol)

- Market data
  - Show market data for each waypoints
  - Best prices for this market [1/5/10 percentile of prices]
  - Volume of the market calculated in number of orders, total buy order in hexcoins, other methods...

- Empires :
  - Show empire borders
  - Show watchtowers
  - More info about watchtowers (expiration / war...)
  - Show and search information related to empire (ex : search by empire name, number of tower)
  - Make capital of empire stand out
  - Watchtower optimization algorithm

- Misc :
  - Show region names
  - Show regions grid
  - Show chunks grid
  - bitcraft ingame time
  - traveler quest reset timer
  - user control of what icons are on top
  - legends
  - 3D scene to show resources as they are ingame

- Thoughs about a navigation algorithm
  - input starting position or "locate me" from name
  - input destination
  - Do you want to use waystones ?
  - How many energy do you have ?
  - what do you want to carry ? (% of inventory ?)
  - Does the user want to move cargo ?
  - Calculate zones where its better to move around water than deploying a boat
  - So we need list of deployable from the user
  - calculate total time

- Navigation "addon"
  - Find a way to display an overlaw over bitcraft to show an arrow when the user want to move to a destination

## Pass geoJson with the location.hash

- Possibles attacks : DOS (too many markers) / XSS / Unexpected behavior if malformed string
